The challenge was that the issue seemed intermittent and wasn’t documented.  To solve it, I first replicated the problem locally to understand the exact conditions causing the failure. Then, I reviewed the API code and logs, identifying a race condition in the data fetching logic. I implemented a fix by adding proper asynchronous handling and improved error logging for future debugging.  After testing, the frontend received consistent data, and the errors were resolved. This project taught me the importance of careful debugging, reading documentation, and testing edge cases.",
